# CommandExecutor Improvement Tasks

This document contains a prioritized list of improvement tasks for the CommandExecutor and its commands, ordered by importance and usefulness.

## High Priority Tasks

[ ] Implement missing command actions for frequently used commands
   - Many commands in the HelixCommand enum have empty actionId strings
   - Focus on movement and editing commands first (MOVE_NEXT_LONG_WORD_END, MOVE_PREV_LONG_WORD_END, etc.)

[ ] Add proper error handling in CommandExecutor
   - Add try-catch blocks in executeCommand and executeActionById methods
   - Log errors and provide user feedback when commands fail

[ ] Utilize the lastCommand property in CommandExecutor
   - This property is defined but never used
   - Implement command history for repeating last command

[ ] Implement command result feedback mechanism
   - Return success/failure status from command execution
   - Display feedback to user when appropriate

[ ] Add documentation to HelixCommand enum
   - Add Javadoc/KDoc comments to describe each command's purpose
   - Group commands logically with comments (already started but incomplete)

## Medium Priority Tasks

[ ] Refactor CommandExecutor to use command pattern more explicitly
   - Create a Command interface with execute() method
   - Implement concrete command classes for complex operations
   - This would make the code more maintainable and testable

[ ] Implement SubMenu functionality
   - The SubMenu class exists but is empty
   - Integrate with CommandExecutor for hierarchical command menus

[ ] Add unit tests for CommandExecutor
   - Test basic command execution
   - Test command repetition
   - Test error handling

[ ] Implement command parameter support
   - Enhance executeCommand to handle more complex arguments
   - Support commands that require user input

[ ] Add performance monitoring for command execution
   - Track execution time for commands
   - Identify and optimize slow commands

## Lower Priority Tasks

[ ] Implement undo/redo stack in CommandExecutor
   - Track command history for more sophisticated undo/redo
   - Support compound commands (multiple actions as one logical operation)

[ ] Add command aliases support
   - Allow users to define aliases for common commands
   - Store aliases in configuration

[ ] Implement macro recording and playback
   - Record sequences of commands
   - Save and load macros from configuration

[ ] Add command suggestions
   - Suggest related commands based on usage patterns
   - Show keyboard shortcuts for frequently used commands

[ ] Implement command search functionality
   - Allow users to search for commands by name or description
   - Integrate with IntelliJ's command palette

## Architectural Improvements

[ ] Separate command definition from execution
   - Move HelixCommand enum to its own file
   - Create a CommandRegistry to manage available commands

[ ] Implement a plugin system for commands
   - Allow third-party plugins to register custom commands
   - Define a clear API for command extensions

[ ] Improve configuration system
   - Add validation for command configurations
   - Support hot-reloading of command definitions

[ ] Refactor mode-specific logic
   - Move mode-specific command behavior out of CommandExecutor
   - Create mode-specific command handlers

[ ] Implement proper dependency injection
   - Reduce direct service access via getInstance()
   - Make dependencies explicit in constructors
